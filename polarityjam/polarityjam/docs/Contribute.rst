How can I become a contributor?

Option A - You are experienced in python programming or R programming: Fork the project, implement your idea and make a Pull request.
Together we can solve remaining issues (if any) and you become part of the project!

Option B - You have no clue about programming: Write us! We talk about it and decide what we can do!

Looking forward to your ideas and comments!
